# Objects 2
*Object is an `instance` of a class and its own settings
## Class
*Describes a category or thing.

## Today is Identity, State, and Behavior

### Variables
* Strong Types
* Declare, Initialize, and Use
    * int total = 0; (declaration)
    * total = 5584939; (initialization)
    * runningTotal = total + runningTotal (use)

### Object Reference
* Declare, Initialize, and Use
    * Addess addess1; (declaration)
        * `Right here, what is address1 equal to?`
            * its null
    * addess1 = new Address(); (initialization)
    * currentPostalCode = address1.getPostalCode(); (use)

### Null
* No object at all, does not point to any object at all.
* If we try to call this, we get an exception.
```
NullPointerException
```
#### BlueJ Walkthrough -- incomplete notes, see video linked below.
* Dashed/Dotted line leading to another box is an embedded object

### TTD - Test Driven Development
* Test-driven development (TDD) is all about writin "clean code that works." 
* Basically, your code always has a complete set of tests that exercises its capabilities, and you write new tests as you add to your code. Practiced TDD:
    * Gives you confidence that you code works correctly
    * Helps you quickly find bugs as you write them
    * Focuses you on the design task
    * Helps you completely understand the requireents for your code

## Unit Testing BlueJ Demo
* See Video in google drive to see more clarity - Title for Object 2
