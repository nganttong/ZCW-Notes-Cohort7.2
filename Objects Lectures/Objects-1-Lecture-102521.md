# Objects 1

## Object oriented programming:
* Programming language— Is a dialect which one can express objects or ideas that turn into working programs
	```
	8 types of objected programming
	-Class
	-Object
	-Instance
	-Identity
	-Field
	-State
	-Method
	-Parameter
	```
## Java
*  High level programming language used in business — oracle purchased this, open sourced but it is licensed
### Java Compiler— Byte Code class— JVM — Mac/Windows/Linux
* Highly highly versatile language

## Class
* Code type is a blueprint for an object
	* simplewhileloop() — consider this
	iteration: counter/controls the number

* Unit Testing: Write code but also write program to test the program

* Class— the fundamental concept in OBJECT oriented programming
	* like a “type,” ‘category,” “kind,” or “species” — its a blueprint
	* features in common
	* notion of a class, it does not describe any one given type, just that type as a whole
		* concept of a class gives us the chance to hold that kind if info on those types

## Object
* a particular example of a class
* objects have each of their own settings
* settings— like descriptors

Instance— a specific of a particular type 
	Instance <-> Object — they kinda mean the same thing

Field— “something all circles have” (get definition, A variable defined in a class is called a field. A field is declared by specifying its type and name.)
State— “each circle can be different” — all the fields in the object and their current values, all the things in the field, or in that object in the moment
Method— “All circles can perform this method” —???

Classes have code, not objects, classes normally have code one their fields

Class-describes category or thing
Object- Instance of a class, each object has it owns settings and state of field <— referred to as state

BlueJ— Integrated environment for Java—frustrated but it shows classes
	Subclasses- specializations furthering down the tree in the class hierarchy ie staff or student are specializations of person
	Superclass- inverse of a subclass, student has person as a superclass, liquid has a fluid as superclass
i.e. student is a subclass of person, person is a superclass of student

Example is good to think like how liquid is a fluid, but not all fluids are liquid.

Subclasses gain the attributes of their superclass but not always vice versa.
This is a way of sharing code between classes, that is what superclass is all about

Inside of a given class is the Java.

Project is made up of files in a program inside of BlueJ
