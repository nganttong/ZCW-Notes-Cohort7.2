# How to think like a coder
* Problem-solving skills are almost unianimously the most important qualification that employers look for.
* Demonstrating computational thinking or the ability to break down large, complex, problems is just as valuable (if not more so) than baseline technical skills required for a job. 

## Why is problem so important?
* Dive right in...
    1. Try a solution
    2. If that doesn't work, try another one.
    3. If that doesn't work, repeat step 2 until you luck out...

### The best way?
* A) Having a framework
* B) Practicing it

### Decomposition
* Taking a problem and breaking it down into smaller and smaller pieces

1. Understand
    * Know what exactly is being asked. Most hard problems are hard because you do not understand them (hence why this is the first step).
    * How to know when you understand the problem?
        * When you can explain it in plain English.
    * Do you remember being stuck on a problem?
        * You start explaining it, and you instatly see holes in the logic you didn't see befire?
    * Most coders know this feeling.
    * This is why you should write down your problem, doodle a diagram, or tell someone else about it.

"If you can't explain something in simple terms, you dont understand it." -- Richard Feynman

2. Plan
* Don't dive right into solvng without a plan
* Nothing can help you you if you can't write down the exact steps
* In coding, this means don't start hacking straight away. To get a good plan, answer this question:
    * "Given input X, what are the steps necessary to return output Y?"
* **Sidenote:** Programmers are a great took to help them, its called Comments.

3. Divide
* Do not try to solve one big problem. You will cry
* Breat it into sub-problems. THese sub-problems are much easier to solve. make them SIMPLE
* After solving every sub-problem, connect the dots.
* This technique is the cornerstone of problem-solving. 
(read this step again, if you must). (again) (again)...
Pay attention! 
This is the most important *

 4. Compose
 * Combine those smaller pieces into larger assemblies
 * A system is compsed of group of objects which interact.

 ## If you can't solve a sub-problem, try these:
 
 5. Stuck?
 * **Debug:** Go step by steo through your solution tryng to find where you went wrong
    * Coders call this debugging
* **Reassess:** Take a step back. Look at the problem from another perspective. Is there anything that can be abstracted to a more general approach?
* **Research:** Ahh, good olâ€™ Google. You read that right. No matter what problem you have, someone has probably solved it. Find that person/ solution. In fact, do this even if you solved the 
    * **Sidenote:** Another way of reassessing is starting new.
