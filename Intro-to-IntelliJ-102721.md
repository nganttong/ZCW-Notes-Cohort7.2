### Shortcuts
* psvm - public static void main...
* sout - System.out.println...
* command + N
* using the first letter in a variable or method member (case sensitive)
* IntelliJ has error intelligence, can spot errors real time (this is handy)
* generating pojo's

IntelliJ can infer intentions..

## ctrl/command + alt + o
* Alphabatize and auto remove any imports
## ctrl/command + alt + l
* auto formats indentation

To rename a variable while it is in multiple places in your code, shortcut is shift + f6 OR right click, refactor, rename

### Optimizing Workflow in general

* ctrl + tab -- flips between different tabs in firefox, for chrome this indexes through
* command ` -- changes between two instances of firefox/applications

shift + command + (up arrow) -- redorders the methods

command + "click" takes you to teh definition
